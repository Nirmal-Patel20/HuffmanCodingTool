Huffman coding is a method of data compression that assigns variable-length codes to input characters.
Shorter codes are given to more frequent characters, while longer codes go to rarer ones.
This allows for efficient storage and transmission of data.
By analyzing character frequency, Huffman coding builds an optimal prefix tree for encoding.
